Lysistrata is the absurdest comedy about the war-weary women of Athens who band together in a sex strike to end the Peloponnesian war. It's the first time the West hit upon many ideas. One idea – the “crazy” notion that woman can participate in political life – was to be picked up by Plato and would reverberate from that time onwards. It is an idea that only today holds the promise of delivering sustained benefit to civilization. Will women be allowed to participate in political life without being vilified as Medusa? Will women be allowed to create their own path without following in aggressive male models? As the election with Hillary Clinton shows, the answer is "NO!".
