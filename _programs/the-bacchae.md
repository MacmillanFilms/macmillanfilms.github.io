This beautifully staged production of Euripides 406 BC masterpiece is based on Peter Arnott's audience-friendly translation. The story follows Dionysos (played by Mia Perovetz) visiting Thebes disguised as a charismatic young leader at the center of a horde of erotic female bacchae. The immortal play exposes the dangers of fanaticism and deals with the timeless human quest to balance order and spontaneity.
