Come join us for a staging of the only complete Satyr play to survive antiquity - "The Cyclops". Staged in the manner of Peter Arnott with 9-string marionettes which preserves the effect of classical masks - this staging includes all entire play including the hilarious chorus section.  Satyr plays are the 4th plays of trilogies - they ran at the end of 3-play dramas sequences and were shorter and features a chorus of comic satyrs - half man half horse followers of Dionysos. So classical drama trilogies always ended on a high, fun, note - the Satyr play. The Cyclops is a jewel of a play that tells the story of Odysseus's harrowing hiatus on the island of the man-eating Cyclops.  There's only one 4th play - only one Cyclops, so see it now!
