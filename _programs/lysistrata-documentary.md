This Documentary featuring Jane Fonda, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Carol Jenkins, Katha Pollitt and focuses on the provocative ideas in Aristophanes' classic Greek play Lysistrata. A comedy about a sex strike to end war, presages the rise of female leadership from a joke to a necessary reality. Aristophanes' timeless comedy about a sex strike and a power grab, reveals much about the ancient archetypes that still impact current political thought.
