The complete Oresteia is now available and includes Agamemnon, Libation Bearers and Eumenides.

Director James Thomas, brings together a talented young cast and Peter Arnott's faithful translation, to unleash the gruesome raw power of the Oresteia. This beautifully-spoken original staging makes vivid the poetry and wisdom - and the themes of terror, revenge and justice - that are Aeschylus' eternal trilogy.<script src="https://gumroad.com/js/gumroad.js"></script>\
