# Educational Mission {#educational-mission}

MacMillan Films is dedicated to producing thoughtful educational programing that instructs and inspires. Our mission is to produce programs that preserve Western civilization and communicate the benefits of a pluralist society. Many of our titles are Greek dramas and documentaries about philosophy and democracy. We focus on ancient Greek culture and art because so much of modern thought stems from this era.

If you have a suggestion for programming that you think we should consider – or are looking for a content producer, please send us an [e-mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or **call (917) 664-0507**.
