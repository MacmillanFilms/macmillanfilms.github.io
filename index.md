# Educational Mission {#educational-mission}

MacMillan Films is dedicated to producing thoughtful educational programing that instructs and inspires. Our mission is to produce programs that showcases Democratic values and the benefits of a pluralist society. Many of our titles are Greek dramas and documentaries about philosophy and democracy. We produce a lot on ancient Greek culture and art because so much of modern thought stems from the "golden era" of 5th century BC Athens.
