And and we have just staged  [Cato by Joseph Addison](https://www.macmillanfilms.com/programs/cato) - George Washington's favorite play - about the last day of democracy in ancient Rome. Below - Sempronius sends the insurrection leader to death:

## Educational Mission {#educational-mission}

MacMillan Films is dedicated to producing thoughtful educational programing that instructs and inspires. Our mission is to produce programs that showcases Democratic values and the benefits of a pluralist society. Many of our titles are Greek dramas and documentaries about philosophy and democracy. We produce a lot on ancient Greek culture and art because so much of modern thought stems from the "golden era" of 5th century Democratic Athens.
