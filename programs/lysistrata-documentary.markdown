As Hillary Clinton’s campaign pushes boundaries on female leadership, this documentary explores Aristophanes' masterpiece about female civic power.  Interviews include Jane Fonda, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Carol Jenkins, Senator Liz Krueger and Katha Pollitt.  Aristophanes' timeless comedy about a sex strike and a power grab, reveals much about the ancient archetypes that still impact current political thought.
