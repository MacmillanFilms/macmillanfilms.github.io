![Lysistrata: Beyond Sex](https://macmillancdn.appspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LYSISTRATAcompSM.jpg)

Lysistrata is an absurdest comedy about the war-weary women of Athens who band together in a sex strike to end the Peloponnesian war – is the first time the West hit upon many new ideas. One idea – the “crazy” notion that woman can participate in political life -- was to be picked up by Plato and would reverberate in the West from that time onwards. It is an idea that only today holds the promise of delivering sustained benefit to civilization. Will woman be allowed to participate in political life without being vilified as Medusa? Will woman be allowed to create their own path without following in aggressive male models? Or will we continue to demonized powerful woman in all the scared male projections found in our Greek cultural inheritance?  As the election with Hillary Clinton shows, the jury is still out.
